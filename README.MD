# NLP Learning Cycle 🚀  
A Practical Project to Understand RNN, LSTM, and Transformer Limitations

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **learning-oriented NLP project** designed to demonstrate **why different sequence models exist** and **when each one fails or succeeds**.

Instead of directly jumping to advanced models (like Transformers), we follow a **learning cycle**:
- Start with simple models
- Observe their limitations
- Introduce improved architectures step by step

The goal is **understanding through practice**, not just achieving high accuracy.

## 🧠 Learning Cycle Concept

Small Dataset + Short Sequences

↓

RNN works (appears good)

↓
Longer Sequences / Larger Data

↓
RNN fails

↓

LSTM improves

↓

Very Large Data / Long Dependencies

↓

LSTM struggles

↓

Transformer succeeds


Each experiment in this repository represents **one step in this cycle**.

## 📊 Dataset

**IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**  
- Binary sentiment classification (positive / negative)
- Real-world text data
- Variable-length reviews

Why IMDb?
- Standard NLP dataset
- Suitable for sequence modeling
- Allows controlled experiments with short and long sequences

The dataset is loaded using `torchtext` to keep preprocessing simple and reproducible.

## 🧪 Experiments Description

### Experiment 1 – RNN (Small Dataset)
- IMDb reviews
- Truncated sequences
- Shows that vanilla RNN can appear effective

⚠️ This setup is intentionally simplified and not realistic.

---

### 🔹 Experiment 2: RNN with Long Sequences
**File:** `exp2_rnn_long.py`

- Same dataset
- Longer sequences
- No architectural changes

Expected outcome:
- Training instability
- Poor performance

This experiment demonstrates the **vanishing gradient problem** in RNNs.

---

### 🔹 Experiment 3: LSTM on the Same Data
**File:** `exp3_lstm.py`

- Same data as Experiment 2
- Replace RNN with LSTM

Expected outcome:
- Improved performance
- More stable training

This shows how **gated mechanisms** help model long-term dependencies.

---

### 🔹 Experiment 4: Transformer Model
**File:** `exp4_transformer.py`

- Large dataset
- Long sequences
- Self-attention instead of recurrence

Expected outcome:
- Better scalability
- Faster training
- Strong performance

This explains why Transformers dominate modern NLP.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch
- torchtext
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways
- Model choice depends on data characteristics
- RNNs are limited by sequential processing
- LSTMs mitigate but do not eliminate these issues
- Transformers solve long-range dependency problems efficiently

## 📌 Final Note
This repository is designed as a **learning journey**, not a benchmark competition.
Understanding *why models fail* is more important than achieving perfect accuracy.
